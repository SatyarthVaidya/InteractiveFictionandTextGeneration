The game is based on an item from the famous movie and book series Harry Potter. The game map is of a clock specifically Weasely’s Clock which is found in Ron’s ( a character in the movie) home and has been a part of his home for ages. The clock’s stops running as the DarkLord is here and it is the user’s responsibility to fix it. The clock reparation begins at each hand that is the second hand, minute hand and hour hand. At each level there are different obstacles which must be tackled using traps and spells. The clock architecture is intriguing as each level must be passed in order to go ahead and there is no way to bypass it. It has been created in a fantasy land and the group’s favourite magic related movie is Harry Potter. Use of magic gives the additional advantage of using spells instead of physical obstructions.
